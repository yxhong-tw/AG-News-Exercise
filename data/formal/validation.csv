4,Comparing Australian Foreign Policy With Respect To Terrorism,"  Australia is facing a federal election on October 9th with the two main parties having little to separate them in domestic and economic policy. Where the Liberal and Labor parties differ greatly is in foreign policy. The Liberal Party adheres to the ""Great and Powerful Friends"" doctrine while the Labor Party pursues the doctrine of ""Asian Engagement"".        Since the September 11th attacks on the United States, terrorism has been thrust to the fore as the dominant security issue facing western nations. Australia has not had a terrorist attack on its shores; but two attacks in Bali and Jakarta have occurred in Indonesia that can be construed as terrorist attacks against Australia. Consequently terrorism for Australia is a foreign policy issue. On this basis the competing foreign policies of the Liberal Party and Labor Party can be compared.  "

In particular, I began to hunt down the available fixed-width or monospaced fonts.    What are monospaced fonts you ask? From Xerox:Monospace fonts (Such as Courier or LetterGothic), or ""fixed pitch"" fonts, contain characters that all have the same character width, producing text that can be used to create forms, tabular material or documents that require exact text line lengths. An example of a fixed pitch font is Courier 12 pitch, which is a 10 point font that will print at exactly 12 characters per inch.    Why use  monospaced fonts? Primarily because the text will align more readily. Especially is areas like the comment block header. Updated versions of this document will be located at http://www.lowing.org/fonts/"
